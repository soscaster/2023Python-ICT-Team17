# Advanced Programming With Python - Group Project
## Topic 28. Book Store Information Management System (e.g. Tien Phong bookstore) 

## üìù Description
This project is a book store information management system. It is a GUI-friendly application that allows admins and staffs to manage the book store's information. The application is written in Python 3 and uses the Tkinter library for the GUI. The application is also connected to a SQLite database to store the information.

## üìù Project Status
We started this project from Mar 22, 2023 and the latest repository commit was made on Apr 18, 2023 (more information can be found in the commit history). The project was initially planned to be finished in 2 weeks with basic GUI and functions, but due to the extend of deadline, we had a chance to improve the project. After tests and bug fixes, we decided to finish the project. The project basically is ready to be used, some minor bugs may still exist.

Actually the commit history is not showing the real contribution of each member. We had a lot of discussions at the library to decide what to do for each project's progress. In order for the members not to create many structurally different pieces of code, we decided to focus on a single machine (leader's potato machine) during early development. After the basic features have been usable, members will be able to create advanced features based on the original code. We have discussed and considered a lot about adding and removing some features that the members have created themselves to include in the final version. 
We also had a lot of bugs to fix, and a lot of research to find the best way to fix them. 
But there's a major bug that we cannot fix (but not affect the usage of the application), you can read it at the "Requirements" section.

After all, we had a lot of fun working on this project. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it (except when we have to fix bugs).
